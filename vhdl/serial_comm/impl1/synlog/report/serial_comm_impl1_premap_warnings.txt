@W: MT531 :"/home/dnl/Documents/gitStuff/misc/vhdl/serial_comm/clk_generator.vhd":44:8:44:9|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 5 sequential elements including count_next[3:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
