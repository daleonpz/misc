# Using Argumentation to Explain Ambiguity in Requirements Elicitation Interviews
One of the major causes of ambiguities in elicitation interviews is the prescense of tacit knowlegde.
In some cases ambiguities can't be always be explained as separated term, sometimes it is required to have a context. 
Even under these circunstances, the analyst must be able to identify and alleviate them in order to elicitate relevant information of the system. 
For this purpose it is necessary to provide the analyst with proper tools.
In this paper Yehia Elrakaiby et al. [@elrakaiby2017using] proposed a theorical framework to overcome ambiguity during interviews in the elicitation phase.
The framework is based on the "Argumentation theory". 

In that sense, Elrakaiby et al. focus on one type of ambiguities, the "acceptance unclarity". 
An acceptance unclarity occurs everytime the analyst is able to assign an interpretation or meaning to the speech fragment of the stakeholder, the interpretation matches the intended meaning of the stakeholder, but the interpretation is not acceptable or justified. 
It could be either because it seems to be inaccurate to comprehend the problem, or analysts identify inconsistencies with their current understanding of the problem or domain knowlegde. 
By using argumentation theory framework, statements and  ambiguities can be characterized as "arguments" and  "attacks" respectevely.

Argumentation theory models a type of human dialog based on arguments and conclusions.
It makes explicit attacks between arguments and the argumentation flow that leads to conclusions.
A basic model in this framework is a pair $(A,D)$, where $A$ is a set of arguments and $D$ is a set of attacks among those arguments. 
For example, a set $A$ is defined as $A = \{A1,A2,A3\}$, and a possible set of attacks could be $D = \{(A1,A3)\}$. 
Which means that if A1 is realizable then A3 can't be realizable.

In the paper, Elrakaiby et al. models statements given by the stakeholders, analysts domain knowlegde and analysts inferences as arguments, and ambiguities between them as attacks.
For example, let say the analyst listens the following statement  _the professor will upload the task description within three days_ (A1), but the analyst know (domain knowlegde) that _the professor may be on a business meeting_ (A2), so the analyst think (inference) that _it may be possible that it will be take longer to upload the task description_ (A3). 
In this scenario the set of attacks $D$ is given by $D = \{(A1,A3)\}$.
Thus, since there is an attack it is possible to ask for clarifications or details.

The theorical framework proposed by Elrakaiby et al. allows analysts to detect and  minimize ambiguities during elicitation interviews, while most of the methods that focus on  ambiguities analyze written texts. 
On the other hand, this framework focuses in more complex ambiguities that cannot be view as single terms.


# What i ll focus
- Explain acceptance unclarity
- Explain Dung's framework
- Explain ASPIC+
- Inconsistencies
- It's higly influenced by the domain knowledge of the analyst

## My idea
- knowledge domain has influence
- analyst domain knowledge is statiscally relevant
- analyst training is even more relevant
- influence of tacit knowlegde in interviews

- ambiguity in interviews - focus on interviewer must have domain knowledge 
- what i want to do is : possible beneficts in requirement elicitaiton is usings two techniques based on the domain knowledge of the analyst, sometimes it is good to have an expert and an ignorant of a topic .

- limitations of the technique based on domain knowlegde and tacit knowlegde. 
- how types of tacit knowlegde may influence in the proposal theory
- how domain knowlegde may influence in the proposal theory

- As an intro:
    - analyst domain knowledge is statiscally relevant
    - analyst training is even more relevant
- focus on the technique from the perspective of knowlegde and technique
- future of that technique to solve more complex problems, from the prospective of knowlegde and technique
