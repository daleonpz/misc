\section{Using Argumentation to Explain Ambiguity in Requirements
Elicitation
Interviews}\label{using-argumentation-to-explain-ambiguity-in-requirements-elicitation-interviews}}

One of the major causes of ambiguities in elicitation interviews is the
prescense of tacit knowlegde. In some cases ambiguities can't be always
be explained as separated term, sometimes it is required to have a
context. Even under these circunstances, the analyst must be able to
identify and alleviate them in order to elicitate relevant information
of the system. For this purpose it is necessary to provide the analyst
with proper tools. In this paper Yehia Elrakaiby et al. {[}1{]} proposed
a theorical framework to overcome ambiguity during interviews in the
elicitation phase. The framework is based on the ``Argumentation
theory''.

In that sense, Elrakaiby et al.~focus on one type of ambiguities, the
``acceptance unclarity''. An acceptance unclarity occurs everytime the
analyst is able to assign an interpretation or meaning to the speech
fragment of the stakeholder, the interpretation matches the intended
meaning of the stakeholder, but the interpretation is not acceptable or
justified. It could be either because it seems to be inaccurate to
comprehend the problem, or analysts identify inconsistencies with their
current understanding of the problem or domain knowlegde. By using
argumentation theory framework, statements and ambiguities can be
characterized as ``arguments'' and ``attacks'' respectevely.

Argumentation theory models a type of human dialog based on arguments
and conclusions. It makes explicit attacks between arguments and the
argumentation flow that leads to conclusions. A basic model in this
framework is a pair \((A,D)\), where \(A\) is a set of arguments and
\(D\) is a set of attacks among those arguments. For example, a set
\(A\) is defined as \(A = \{A1,A2,A3\}\), and a possible set of attacks
could be \(D = \{(A1,A3)\}\). Which means that if A1 is realizable then
A3 can't be realizable.

In the paper, Elrakaiby et al.~models statements given by the
stakeholders, analysts domain knowlegde and analysts inferences as
arguments, and ambiguities between them as attacks. For example, let say
the analyst listens the following statement \emph{the professor will
upload the task description within three days} (A1), but the analyst
know (domain knowlegde) that \emph{the professor may be on a business
meeting} (A2), so the analyst think (inference) that \emph{it may be
possible that it will be take longer to upload the task description}
(A3). In this scenario the set of attacks \(D\) is given by
\(D = \{(A1,A3)\}\). Thus, since there is an attack it is possible to
ask for clarifications or details.

The theorical framework proposed by Elrakaiby et al.~allows analysts to
detect and minimize ambiguities during elicitation interviews, while
most of the methods that focus on ambiguities analyze written texts. On
the other hand, this framework focuses in more complex ambiguities that
cannot be view as single terms.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  knowledge domain has influence
\item
  analyst domain knowledge is statiscally relevant
\item
  analyst training is even more relevant
\item
  influence of tacit knowlegde in interviews
\item
  ambiguity in interviews - focus on interviewer must have domain
  knowledge
\item
  what i want to do is : possible beneficts in requirement elicitaiton
  is usings two techniques based on the domain knowledge of the analyst,
  sometimes it is good to have an expert and an ignorant of a topic .
\item
  limitations of the technique based on domain knowlegde and tacit
  knowlegde.
\item
  how types of tacit knowlegde may influence in the proposal theory
\item
  how domain knowlegde may influence in the proposal theory
\item
  As an intro:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    analyst domain knowledge is statiscally relevant
  \item
    analyst training is even more relevant
  \end{itemize}
\item
  focus on the technique from the perspective of knowlegde and technique
\item
  future of that technique to solve more complex problems, from the
  prospective of knowlegde and technique
