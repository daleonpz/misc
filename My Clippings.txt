If you have recently seen or heard the word EAT, you are temporarily more likely to complete the word fragment SO_P as SOUP than as SOAP. The opposite would happen, of course, if you had just seen WASH. We call this a priming effect and say that the idea of EAT primes the idea of SOUP, and that WASH primes SOAP.

The general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility. Compare these two statements: Adolf Hitler was born in 1892. Adolf Hitler was born in 1887. Both are false (Hitler was born in 1889), but experiments have shown that the first is more likely to be believed. More advice: if your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background. If you use color, you are more likely to be believed if your text is printed in bright blue or red than in middling shades of green, yellow, or pale blue

Zajonc argued that the effect of repetition on liking is a profoundly important biological fact, and that it extends to all animals. To survive in a frequently dangerous world, an organism should react cautiously to a novel stimulus, with withdrawal and fear. Survival prospects are poor for an animal that is not suspicious of novelty. However, it is also adaptive for the initial caution to fade if the stimulus is actually safe. The mere exposure effect occurs, Zajonc claimed, because the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal, and safety is good. Obviously, this argument is not restricted to humans. To make that point, one of Zajonc’s associates exposed two sets of fertile chicken eggs to different tones. After they hatched, the chicks consistently emitted fewer distress calls when exposed to the tone they had heard while inhabiting the shell

Implementing interview procedures in the spirit of Meehl and Dawes requires relatively little effort but substantial discipline. Suppose that you need to hire a sales representative for your firm. If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it— six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will caleigl “very weak” or “very strong.”

Loss aversion refers to the relative strength of two motives: we are driven more strongly to avoid losses than to achieve gains. A reference point is sometimes the status quo, but it can also be a goal in the future: not achieving a goal is a loss, exceeding the goal is a gain. As we might expect from negativity dominance, the two motives are not equally powerful. The aversion to the failure of not reaching the goal is much stronger than the desire to exceed it.

The asymmetry is at least as strong for losses, and it applies to blame as well as to regret

It is typical for both people in a relationship to believe they are doing at least their fair share. After all, they see everything they do and forgo for the relationship, and they do not see everything the other person does or forgoes. In the most successful couples, both partners understand that their perceptions of what they contribute are biased, so to make sure they are properly tending to the relationship, they try to do more than their share.

Idealizing the partner does not mean overlooking deceit or abuse or other serious issues, but it may mean focusing on the still beautiful smile instead of the cellulite or the thinning hair, or recognizing the way he shows his love by scraping the ice off your car, even if he could be better at using words to express his feelings.

forming connections with pets or online friends or even God is a noble attempt by an obligatorily gregarious creature to satisfy a compelling need.

If running a bath steams up your bathroom excessively, the problem could be partly solved by warming the air in the bathroom. Warmer air can hold more moisture without producing condensation. Running some cold water into the bath first, followed by hot—piped UNDER this cold water with a shower attachment—will also help cut down on steam.

REMEMBER When leaving a recorded message on a telephone answering machine, try to invent something which does not say, ‘We are not here at the moment’. Phrases like: ‘We cannot come to the phone at the moment’ leave a certain vagueness as to whether the house is occupied or not.

It could be a mutual fund, a REIT, a stock or a bond. It is a good clean and simple way of investing. An example would be a shopper who goes to a computer store and buys a computer right off the shelf. The second type are investors who create investments. This investor usually assembles a deal, much like there are people who buy components of computers and put it together. It’s like customizing.

If you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially free, they would say “yes.” But then reality sets in. The road seems too long with too many hills to climb. It’s easier to just work for money and hand the excess over to your broker.
